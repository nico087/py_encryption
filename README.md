# py_encryption
A freelance project for encrypting and decrypting files with Python

A customer wanted to encrypt files with a Python script. There are two python files: file_encryption and file_decryption. 

First, the user has to input a password for encryption and then a path to a folder in which the user wants to encrypt files. Same instructions for the decryption process.

Required library:
- pyAesCrypt
